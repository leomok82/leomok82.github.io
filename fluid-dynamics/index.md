## Scalable Generative model for Computational Physics
Article title "SCALED : SCALable gEnerative founDational model for Computational Physics demonstrated on Urban Flow" under publication.

# Project Overview
SCALED is a scalable foundational model built on a diffusion based generative framework for computational physics, developing a novel method to generalize computational fluid dynamics models to smaller or larger domains at any resolution. 

With inspiration from traditional numerical solvers, SCALED incorporates grid invariance and scale invariance by using through domain decomposition, with efficient boundary condition exchange across subdomains. SCALED massively outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven deep learning numerical solvers in multiple benchmarks.

We have demonstrated SCALED on a urban flow scenario with complex building geometries. Our tool has numerous applications in monitoring air quality and pollution in urban environments.
